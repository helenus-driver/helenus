/**
 * The <code>Group</code> interface defines support for a statement that can
 * execute a set of statements in parallel returning the result from the first
 * one that fails. Basically, a group will sends multiple requests to Cassandra
 * at the same time up to either its parallel factor or until it reaches a
 * sequence statement and then wait for all results before continuing to the
 * next set of statements to be sent in parallel.
 * <p>
 * The group's algorithm will allow the distributed nature of Cassandra to work
 * for you and distribute the writes to the optimal destination which leads to
 * not only fastest inserts/updates (assuming different partitions are being
 * updated), but itâ€™ll cause the least load on the cluster.
